My Landing Page project for The Odin Project. A test of my HTML and CSS skills so far.

I was still very confused about Flexbox when I started this project. I ended up making some very ridiculously poor organization choices, and I had numerous flex containers within flex containers. I eventually realized how to achieve most of the goals of the project and knew it would be far simpler to just start the project over. I reverted to an old version, but upon making all my changes I ran into an error with git so I was unable to simply push my changes bit by bit as I expected. I understand now this is due to my remote repo being "ahead" of the local repo.

Ultimately, I found it simplest to just force push all my changes, even though that seems to have gotten rid of all my previous commits. This was in an of itself a lesson for the project, I got a bit more understanding of how git works.

Known Issue(s):
-The subtext under the images uses text-align: center which may not be ideal, it does not fully match the reference image.
-Certain elements do not flex as expected, most notably the "placeholder image" in the Hero section
